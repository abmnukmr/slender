Slender is lightweight but rapid application development framework for PHP (>=5.4)

Built on top of the excellent [Slim](http://slimframework.com) micro-framework, Slender
aims to provide all the tools you'd expect from a full-blown application framework like
Zend or Symfony, but without a lot of the bloat and endless bootstrapping that can waste
a lot of time when trying to add a new feature to your app.


## Features

<div class="col-md-6">
    <h4>Configuration Manager</h4>
    <p>
        Configure your application using config
        files in the format you prefer. Currently
        supporting YAML,JSON and PHP Arrays, config
        files are merged as they are loaded so
        overloading or extending settings is a doddle.
    </p>
</div>
<div class="col-md-6">
    <h4>Module System</h4>
    <p>
        Organise your code into modules to group
        features, functionality or just to keep
        things tidy. Slender Modules are as easy
        as writing 3 lines in a text file.
