Slender is lightweight but rapid application development framework for PHP (>=5.4)

Built on top of the excellent [Slim](http://slimframework.com) micro-framework, Slender
provides a toolkit for quickly putting together a modular PHP application.


## Features

<div class="col-md-6">
    <h4>Configuration Manager</h4>
    <p>
        Configure your application using config
        files in the format you prefer. Currently
        supporting YAML,JSON and PHP Arrays, config
        files are merged as they are loaded so
        overloading or extending settings is a doddle.
    </p>
</div>
<div class="col-md-6">
    <h4>Module System</h4>
    <p>
        Organise your code into modules to group
        features, functionality or just to keep
        things tidy. Slender Modules are as easy
        as writing 3 lines in a text file.
